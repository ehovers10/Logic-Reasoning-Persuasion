\begin{quote}
  Neil is looking to adopt a puppy, and he wants one that will be friendly around the children in his neighborhood. Neil's friend Stan has a cocker spaniel that is friendly around children.  Based on this, Neil concludes that a cocker spaniel puppy would make a good choice for adoption.

\item Bonnie, Edmund, and Chuck all have cocker spaniels that are friendly with children.\underline{\hspace{5cm}}

\item Stan's dog wears a green collar, and Neil's will get a green collar, too. \underline{\hspace{5cm}}

\item Bonnie, Edmund, and Chuck's cocker spaniels are all from the same litter.\underline{\hspace{5cm}}

\item Neil decides that he doesn't need the puppy to be especially friendly as long as it at least tolerates children.\underline{\hspace{5cm}}

\paragraph{Probability}

Using the values provided, calculate the indicated probability. (\textbf{2 points each})

\resume{enumerate}\setlength\itemsep{1.5cm}

\item Let $P(M)=\frac{2}{5}$, $P(R)=\frac{5}{6}$, $P(\given{R}{M})=\frac{3}{8}$, and assume $R$ and $M$ are dependent events. 

Calculate $P(\conjoin{M}{R})$. 

\item Let $P(A)=\frac{1}{4}$, $P(D)=\frac{2}{3}$, $P(\conjoin{A}{\negate{D}})=\frac{1}{12}$, and assume $R$ and $M$ are dependent events.

\paragraph{Bayes' rule}

Answer the next two answers in one or two sentences. (\textbf{3 points each})

\resume{enumerate}\setlength\itemsep{1.5cm}

\item How does Bayes' rule help us avoid the \textit{base rate fallacy}?

\item What does the value of the likelihood in Bayes' rule tell us?

\suspend{enumerate}

\vspace{1.5cm}

You want to know why the dog keeps barking all night long. The barking is your evidence ($E$). You think one of the following is the explantion: \textit{there's some animal outside the kennel ($H_1$)} or \textit{there's a burglar attempting to break into the house ($H_2$)}.  You consider both hypotheses to explain the evidence well: $P(\given{E}{H_1})=P(\given{E}{H_2})=0.9$. As you lie in bed, you figure that you can assign the following prior probabilities: $P(H_1)=0.7$ and $P(H_2)=0.3$. 

\resume{enumerate}

\item Use Bayes' rule to calculate the probability that there is a burglar outside, given that your dog is barking. Show your work. (\textbf{3 points})

\suspend{enumerate}

\vspace{2cm}

\paragraph{Decision theory}

Your favorite band is coming to town and you really want to see the show. You're trying to decide whether to buy tickets online beforehand or to just pick them up at the door the night of. If you buy them at the door they are cheaper, but there's a chance they will sell out before the night of the show, in which case you won't get to see the band at all. Based on all this, you put together the following decision matrix:

\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|}
 & Tix don't sell out & Tix sell out \\ \hline
Buy online & -2 & +7 \\ \hline
Buy at the door & +8 & -14 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Use this decision matrix and the informaton provided to answer the questions below. Partial credit will be given if you show your work.

\resume{enumerate}\setlength\itemsep{1.5cm}

\item They're a somewhat obscure band, so you think the chance they sell out is no more than $30\%$. Calculate the expected utilities for buying the tickets online and for buying them at the door. (\textbf{3 points})\label{eus}

\item Based on your calculation, what do you decide to do? (\textbf{2 point})

\item You start to get worried that the show might sell out, and you change the probability of a sell out to $60\%$.  Does this affect your decision? Why or why not? (\textbf{2 points})\label{sellout}

For each of the prompts that follow, circle the letter of the line that best completes the sentence. (\textbf{2 points each})
