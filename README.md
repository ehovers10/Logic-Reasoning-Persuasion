# Logic, Reason, and Persuasion

This repo contains the course materials Erik Hoversten's sections of Phil 101 at Rutgers University, fall 2014. The resources include lectures, assignments, and exams. 

The format is primarily LaTeX with some HTML based on the [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) presentation framework.

The [macros](/macros) folder contains a LaTeX macro for rendering categorical propositions and syllogysms and the Beamer template for the lecture presentations.

Lecture materials were developed by Erik Hoversten based on [Hurley's *A Concise Introduction to Logic, 12th ed*](https://books.google.com/books?id=WWcXjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:ISBN0840034172).
